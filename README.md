# **WHILE Syntax Highlighter**

A Sublime Text syntax highlighter for the extended WHILE language, as used in the [Limits of Computation](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/modules/undergraduate/2020/G5029-limits-of-computation "About the module") module at the University of Sussex.

**Authors:** Toby Dennison; Bernhard Reus.

Many thanks to Bernhard for reviewing the highlighter's syntax coverage and the suitability of the colours used.

If you spot any errors, please let us know.

**Tip for Speedy WHILE Programming:** Download Sublime packages [Terminus](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminus "Get Terminus") and [Origami](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Origami "Get Origami") to open a terminal window *inside of* Sublime and position it where you like, respectively.

**Note:** The highlighter was not made for **Visual Studio Code** as it involves a bit more work than Sublime. If anyone wants to have a go at making a VS Code version, please let Bernhard know.
